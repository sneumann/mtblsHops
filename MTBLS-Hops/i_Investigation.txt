Study Title	"Metabolite profiling and fingerprinting of commercial cultivars of Humulus lupulus: a comparison of MS and NMR methods in metabolomics"
Study Description	"Hop (Humulus lupulus L. Cannabaceae) is an economically important crop. In addition to its role in beer brewing, its pharmaceutical applications have been of increasing importance in recent years. Bitter acids (prenylated polyketides), prenylflavonoids and essential oils, are the primary phytochemical components that account for hop medicinal value. An integrated approach utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques was used for the first large-scale metabolite profiling in Humulus lupulus. Resins and extracts prepared from 13 hop cultivars were analysed using NMR, liquid chromatography (LC)-MS and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)-MS in parallel and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). A one pot extraction method, compatible with both MS and NMR measurement was developed to help rule out effects due to differences in extraction protocols. Under optimised conditions, we were able to simultaneously quantify and identify 46 metabolites including 18 bitter acids, 12 flavonoids, 3 terpenes, 3 fatty acids and 2 sugars. Cultivars segregation in PCA plots generated from both LC-MS and NMR data were found comparable and mostly influenced by differences in bitter acids composition among cultivars. FTICR-MS showed inconsistent PCA loading plot results which are likely due to preferential ionisation and also point to the presence of novel isoprenylated metabolites in hop. This comparative metabolomic approach provided new insights for the complementariness and coincidence for these different technology platform applications in hop and similar plant metabolomics projects."

Study Protocol Description	"For NMR analysis, 4 ml were aliquoted using a syringe and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen till dryness. Dried extracts were resuspended with 800 �_l 100% acetone-d 6 containing HMDS (0.94 mM), which served as an internal chemical shift NMR standard. After centrifugation (13000g for 1 min), the supernatant was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. Acetone-d 6 was added only prior to NMR acquisition to prevent possible reaction with the sample."	"The derivatised samples were analysed using a Thermo Trace GC coupled to a Voyager MS equipment (ThermoElectron, San Jose, USA) operating in EI mode at 70 eV and scanning from m/z 50���650. Samples were injected at a 1:1 split ratio, and the inlet and transfer line were held at 280�C. Separation was achieved with a temperature program of 80�C for 2 min, then ramped at 5�C min���1 to 315�C and held for 12 min, a 60 m DB-5MS column (J&W Scientific, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 �_m film thickness) and a constant flow of 1.0 ml min���1. MS interface and ion source were set at 280�C and 180�C, respectively."	"The positive and negative ion high resolution ESI mass spectra were obtained from a Bruker Apex III Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, USA) equipped with an Infinity cell, a 7.0 Tesla superconducting magnet (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), an RF-only hexapole ion guide and an APOLLO electrospray ion source (Agilent, off axis spray). Nitrogen was used as drying gas at 150�C. The sample solutions were introduced continuously via a syringe pump with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. All data were acquired with a 512 k data points and zero filled to 2048 k by averaging 32 scans. The XMASS 6.1.2 and the Data Analysis Software (DA 4.0), respectively, were used for the calculation of the elemental composition."	"The LC-ESI and ESI-MSn mass spectra were obtained from a LCQ Deca XP MAX system (ThermoElectron, San Jose, USA) equipped with a ESI source (electrospray voltage 4.0 kV, sheath gas: nitrogen; capillary temperature: 275�C). The Ion Trap MS system is coupled with a Surveyor micro-HPLC and equipped with a HYPERSIL GOLD RP18-column (5 mm, 150 �� 1 mm, ThermoScientific). For HPLC a gradient system was used starting from H2O:CH3CN = 90:10 (each of them containing 0.2% HOAc) to 100% CH3CN within 30 min, then isocratically for further 10 min; flow rate 70 �_l/min."	""	"For FTICR- and LC-MS analyses, 500 �_l were aliquoted and placed on a (500 mg) C18 cartridge preconditioned with acetone and water. Samples were then eluted using 6 ml acetone, the eluent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and the obtained dry residue was resuspended in 1 ml methanol. Two �_l were used for LCMS analysis, whereas for FTMS, samples were diluted at a ratio of 1:5 prior to analysis."	"One mg of dried hop resin (HHT) was resuspended in 0.5 ml chloroform and (trans-) esterified by adding 1 ml 1.25 M HCl in MeOH and incubating for 4 h at 65�C. Following the transesterification, HCl and solvent were evaporated under nitrogen. The sample was resuspended in 500 �_l pyridine and transferred to a 200 �_l glass insert."	"All spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS 600 NMR spectrometer operating at a proton NMR frequency of 599.83 MHz using a 5 mm inverse detection cryoprobe. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with the following parameters: digital resolution 0.367 Hz/point (32 K complex data points); pulse width (pw) = 3 �_s (45�); relaxation delay = 23.7 s; acquisition time = 2.7 s; number of transients = 160. Zero filling up to 128 K and an exponential window function with lb = 0.4 was used prior to Fourier transformation. "	""	""	""	""	""
