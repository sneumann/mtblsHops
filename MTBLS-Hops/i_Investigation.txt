Study Identifier	"MTBLS-HOPS"
Study Title	"Metabolite profiling and fingerprinting of commercial cultivars of Humulus lupulus: a comparison of MS and NMR methods in metabolomics"
Study Description	"Hop (Humulus lupulus L. Cannabaceae) is an economically important crop. In addition to its role in beer brewing, its pharmaceutical applications have been of increasing importance in recent years. Bitter acids (prenylated polyketides), prenylflavonoids and essential oils, are the primary phytochemical components that account for hop medicinal value. An integrated approach utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques was used for the first large-scale metabolite profiling in Humulus lupulus. Resins and extracts prepared from 13 hop cultivars were analysed using NMR, liquid chromatography (LC)-MS and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)-MS in parallel and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). A one pot extraction method, compatible with both MS and NMR measurement was developed to help rule out effects due to differences in extraction protocols. Under optimised conditions, we were able to simultaneously quantify and identify 46 metabolites including 18 bitter acids, 12 flavonoids, 3 terpenes, 3 fatty acids and 2 sugars. Cultivars segregation in PCA plots generated from both LC-MS and NMR data were found comparable and mostly influenced by differences in bitter acids composition among cultivars. FTICR-MS showed inconsistent PCA loading plot results which are likely due to preferential ionisation and also point to the presence of novel isoprenylated metabolites in hop. This comparative metabolomic approach provided new insights for the complementariness and coincidence for these different technology platform applications in hop and similar plant metabolomics projects."

Study Protocol Description	"For NMR analysis, 4 ml were aliquoted using a syringe and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen till dryness. Dried extracts were resuspended with 800 μl 100% acetone-d 6 containing HMDS (0.94 mM), which served as an internal chemical shift NMR standard. After centrifugation (13000g for 1 min), the supernatant was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. Acetone-d 6 was added only prior to NMR acquisition to prevent possible reaction with the sample."	""	""	"The positive and negative ion high resolution ESI mass spectra were obtained from a Bruker Apex III Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, USA) equipped with an Infinity cell, a 7.0 Tesla superconducting magnet (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), an RF-only hexapole ion guide and an APOLLO electrospray ion source (Agilent, off axis spray). Nitrogen was used as drying gas at 150°C. The sample solutions were introduced continuously via a syringe pump with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. All data were acquired with a 512 k data points and zero filled to 2048 k by averaging 32 scans. The XMASS 6.1.2 and the Data Analysis Software (DA 4.0), respectively, were used for the calculation of the elemental composition."	""	""	""	""	"All spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS 600 NMR spectrometer operating at a proton NMR frequency of 599.83 MHz using a 5 mm inverse detection cryoprobe. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with the following parameters: digital resolution 0.367 Hz/point (32 K complex data points); pulse width (pw) = 3 μs (45°); relaxation delay = 23.7 s; acquisition time = 2.7 s; number of transients = 160. Zero filling up to 128 K and an exponential window function with lb = 0.4 was used prior to Fourier transformation. "	""	""	""	"The 13 different hop cones and resins included in this study were provided from Hopsteiner (Mainburg, Germany). Dried hop cones were ground with a pestle in a mortar using liquid nitrogen. The powder (60 mg) was then homogenized with 5 ml acetone containing 8 μg/ml umbelliferone (an internal standard for relative quantification using LCMS) using a Turrax mixer (11000 RPM) for five 20 s periods. To prevent heating, a period of 1 min separated each mixing period. Extracts were then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 3000g for 30 min to remove plant debris.
